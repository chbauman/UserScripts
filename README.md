# My UserScripts

Some personal user scripts, written for Chrome with Tampermonkey in JavaScript.
Install by clicking on the <...>.user.js file and viewing in raw mode.

## AdBlock-Blocker Blocker

The two scripts [20min_ad_block_blocker_blocker.user.js](20min_ad_block_blocker_blocker.user.js)
and [tagi_ad_block_blocker_blocker.user.js](tagi_ad_block_blocker_blocker.user.js) 
lets you remove the
pop-up that reminds you to inactivate your ad-block by simply clicking 
enter. The first works for 20 Minuten and the second one for Tagesanzeiger.
Enjoy your reading.
